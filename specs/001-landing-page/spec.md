# Feature Specification: Landing Page

- **Feature Branch**: `001-landing-page`
- **Created**: 2025-10-13
- **Status**: Draft
- **Input**: User description: "First, let's add a landing page. This page has an app navigation bar with the logo picture for "DevFest" on the top left. In the hero section, there is a big logo picture of DevFest Tokyo 2025 with the theme of events. And the most important thing is to ask user to register from the event page on conppass (another site). Please put the botton to navigate the users to the registration site (https://gdg-tokyo.connpass.com/event/369416/). Under the hero panel, there is a welcome message. Please refere to the rough image of the landing page at @@.reference/screenshot/landing_page_1.png"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-13

- Q: Which screenshot should be the primary visual reference for the landing page design? → A: Use `landing_page_1.png` and `landing_page_2.png` as the primary design reference, and use `DevFest 2025 PR - connpass.png` to understand the core concept of the design.
- Q: What items should be included in the navigation bar? → A: Home, Timetable, Sessions
- Q: How should the system handle a situation where the external registration site (Connpass) is down or unavailable? → A: From the button, please open the connpass event page in another tab. So you don't need to handle the error of the registaration site.
- Q: What are the required fields for a session? → A: `title`, `description_long`, `speaker_names`, `time_start`, and `time_end` are required. `id`, `speaker_profiles`, and `track` are also considered required for implementation.
- Q: What is the definitive structure of the `speaker_profiles` object? → A: For each speaker, `name` and `headshot_url` are required, while `company`, `bio`, and `twitter_handle` are optional.
