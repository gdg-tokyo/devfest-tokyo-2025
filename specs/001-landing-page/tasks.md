# Tasks: Landing Page

**Feature**: Landing Page

This document outlines the tasks required to implement the landing page feature, organized by user story.

## Phase 1: Setup

*Goal: Initialize the project and set up the basic structure.*

- [x] **T001**: Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- [x] **T002**: Create the project directory structure as defined in `plan.md` (`src/app`, `src/components`, `src/data`, `public/images`).
- [x] **T003**: Define TypeScript interfaces for `Session` and `SpeakerProfile` in `src/interfaces/index.ts` based on `data-model.md`.

## Phase 2: User Story 2 - Brand Recognition (P2)

*Goal: Create the navigation bar to establish brand identity.*

- [x] **T004** [US2]: Create the `Navbar` component in `src/components/Navbar.tsx`.
- [x] **T005** [US2]: Add the DevFest logo to the `Navbar` component.
- [x] **T006** [US2]: Add navigation links (Home, Timetable, Sessions) to the `Navbar`.
- [x] **T007** [US2]: Integrate the `Navbar` into the main layout in `src/app/layout.tsx`.

**Checkpoint**: The navigation bar is visible on the main page.

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Event Registration (P1)

*Goal: Implement the hero section with the primary call-to-action.*

- [x] **T008** [US1]: Create the `Hero` component in `src/components/Hero.tsx`.
- [x] **T009** [US1]: Add the DevFest Tokyo 2025 logo and event theme to the `Hero` component.
- [x] **T010** [US1]: Add the registration button to the `Hero` component, linking to the Connpass event page.
- [x] **T011** [US1]: Integrate the `Hero` component into the main page `src/app/page.tsx`.

**Checkpoint**: The hero section with the registration button is displayed on the landing page.

## Phase 4: User Story 3 - Welcome Message (P3)

*Goal: Add the welcome message to the landing page.*

- [x] **T012** [US3]: Create the `Welcome` component in `src/components/Welcome.tsx`.
- [x] **T013** [US3]: Add the welcome message content to the `Welcome` component.
- [x] **T014** [US3]: Integrate the `Welcome` component into `src/app/page.tsx`.

**Checkpoint**: The welcome message is visible below the hero section.

## Phase 5: Polish & Integration

*Goal: Finalize the page and ensure all elements are polished.*

- [x] **T015**: Ensure the entire page is responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- [x] **T016**: Replace any placeholder assets with the final brand assets.

## Dependencies

- User Story 1 (Event Registration) is dependent on the basic page setup from Phase 1.
- User Story 2 (Brand Recognition) is dependent on the basic page setup from Phase 1.
- User Story 3 (Welcome Message) is dependent on the basic page setup from Phase 1.

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow a phased approach, starting with the highest priority user story (P1) after the initial setup. Each user story will be implemented as an independent, testable increment.

**MVP Scope**: The MVP will consist of completing User Story 1 and 2, providing the core functionality of event branding and registration.
