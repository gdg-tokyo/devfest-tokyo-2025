# Tasks: Landing Page

**Feature**: Landing Page

This document outlines the tasks required to implement the landing page feature, organized by user story.

## Phase 1: Setup

_Goal: Initialize the project and set up the basic structure._

- [x] **T001**: Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- [x] **T002**: Create the project directory structure as defined in `plan.md` (`src/app`, `src/components`, `src/data`, `public/images`).

## Phase 2: User Story 2 - Brand Recognition (P2)

_Goal: Create the navigation bar to establish brand identity._

- [x] **T004** [US2]: Create the `Navbar` component in `src/components/Navbar.tsx`.
- [x] **T005** [US2]: Add the DevFest logo to the `Navbar` component.
- [x] **T006** [US2]: Add navigation links (Home, Timetable, Sessions) to the `Navbar`.
- [x] **T007** [US2]: Integrate the `Navbar` into the main layout in `src/app/layout.tsx`.

**Checkpoint**: The navigation bar is visible on the main page.

## Phase 3: User Story 3 - Welcome Message (P3)

_Goal: Add the welcome message to the landing page._

- [x] **T012** [US3]: Create the `Welcome` component in `src/components/Welcome.tsx`.
- [x] **T013** [US3]: Add the welcome message content to the `Welcome` component.
- [x] **T014** [US3]: Integrate the `Welcome` component into `src/app/page.tsx`.

**Checkpoint**: The welcome message is visible below the hero section.

## Phase 4: Polish & Integration

_Goal: Finalize the page and ensure all elements are polished._

- [x] **T015**: Ensure the entire page is responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- [x] **T016**: Replace any placeholder assets with the final brand assets.

## Dependencies

- User Story 2 (Brand Recognition) is dependent on the basic page setup from Phase 1.
- User Story 3 (Welcome Message) is dependent on the basic page setup from Phase 1.

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow a phased approach, starting with the highest priority user story (P1) after the initial setup. Each user story will be implemented as an independent, testable increment.

**MVP Scope**: The MVP will consist of completing User Story 2, providing the core functionality of event branding.
