# Tasks: Landing Page Design Update

**Feature**: Landing Page Design Update

This document outlines the tasks required to implement the landing page design update, organized by user story.

## Phase 1: Setup

*Goal: Prepare the project for design updates.*

- [x] **T001**: Install `framer-motion` dependency.
- [x] **T002**: Update `globals.css` to import `Roboto` and `Noto Sans JP` fonts from Google Fonts.
- [x] **T003**: Update `tailwind.config.ts` to define the brand color palette and typography, and extend with `framer-motion` variants if necessary.

## Phase 2: User Story 1 - Enhanced Visual Appeal (P1)

*Goal: Implement the core visual updates for the landing page.*

- [x] **T004** [US1]: Update the `Hero` component (`src/components/Hero.tsx`) to use the CSS gradient background with randomly placed circles.
- [x] **T005** [US1]: Update the `Welcome` component (`src/components/Welcome.tsx`) to be enclosed in a rounded box with a black border and a subtle shadow.
- [x] **T006** [US1]: Incorporate subtle animations for component loading and on-scroll events in `Hero` and `Welcome` components using `framer-motion`.

**Checkpoint**: The hero section and welcome message display the new visual styles and animations.

## Phase 3: User Story 2 - Brand Recognition (P2)

*Goal: Ensure brand consistency and adherence to the design guide.*

- [x] **T007** [US2]: Update the `Navbar` component (`src/components/Navbar.tsx`) to replicate the style of the reference `Header.tsx` component (semi-transparent background, bottom border, spacing).
- [x] **T008** [US2]: Ensure all UI elements (buttons, cards, etc.) are styled consistently with the DevFest brand identity.
- [x] **T009** [US2]: Ensure all typography (fonts, sizes, weights) align with the design guide, specifically using `Roboto` and `Noto Sans JP`.

**Checkpoint**: The navigation bar and all UI elements reflect the DevFest brand identity and typography.

## Phase 4: Polish & Integration

*Goal: Finalize the page and ensure all elements are polished.*

- [x] **T010**: Ensure the entire page is responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- [x] **T011**: Conduct a design review to confirm 100% compliance with the DevFest design guide.

## Dependencies

- User Story 1 (Enhanced Visual Appeal) is dependent on the setup tasks in Phase 1.
- User Story 2 (Brand Recognition) is dependent on the setup tasks in Phase 1.

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow a phased approach, starting with the highest priority user story (P1) after the initial setup. Each user story will be implemented as an independent, testable increment.

**MVP Scope**: The MVP will consist of completing User Story 1, providing the core visual updates and animations.
