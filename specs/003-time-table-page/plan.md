# Implementation Plan: Time Table Page

**Branch**: `003-time-table-page` | **Date**: 2025-10-13 | **Spec**: /specs/003-time-table-page/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-time-table-page/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The primary requirement is to provide attendees with a rapid and efficient way to discover and select sessions, enabling them to plan their conference day effectively. The page will feature an interactive timetable with client-side filtering capabilities and visually distinct session cards, adhering to the DevFest brand guide. The technical approach involves building a Next.js application leveraging client-side filtering for instant updates. Session data will be provided as a JSON asset within the repository. The UI will be a responsive grid, adapting to both desktop and mobile, with strict adherence to the DevFest brand guide for typography and color. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA, color contrast, keyboard navigation) will be a key consideration.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
**Storage**: Local JSON file
**Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library for unit/integration tests. Cypress for E2E tests.
**Target Platform**: Web (Desktop & Mobile)
**Project Type**: Web application
**Performance Goals**: Page load < 2s, filter within 15s
**Constraints**: WCAG 2.1 AA, DevFest brand guide adherence, up to 50 sessions, 5 tracks, 10 time slots
**Scale/Scope**: Up to 50 sessions, 5 tracks, 10 time slots

```

**Structure Decision**: Align with existing Next.js project structure. New page will be in `src/app/timetable/page.tsx`, and new components in `src/components/timetable/`. The session JSON asset will be located in `src/data/sessions.json`.
