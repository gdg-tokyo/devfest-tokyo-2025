# API Contracts

This feature primarily involves client-side rendering from a single local JSON data file (`sessions.json`). Therefore, there are no traditional API contracts (e.g., OpenAPI, GraphQL schemas) to generate for external services.

Data will be consumed from:

*   `sessions.json`: Contains all session, talk, and speaker details.
