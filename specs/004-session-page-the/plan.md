# Implementation Plan: Session Page

**Branch**: `004-session-page-the` | **Date**: 2025-10-13 | **Spec**: /specs/004-session-page-the/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-session-page-the/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The Session Page feature will provide a dedicated route for attendees to view comprehensive details of a single talk. This includes the session title, a long description, skill level, learning perspective, and a profile card for each presenter. The data will be sourced from local JSON files, with sessions/talks in one file and speakers in a separate file, linked by IDs. The page will adhere to the DevFest Tokyo 2025 brand guidelines, be fully responsive, and meet accessibility standards, leveraging Next.js and Tailwind CSS for implementation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
**Storage**: Local JSON file (`sessions.json` for all session, talk, and speaker data)
**Testing**: Jest, Playwright
**Target Platform**: Web (browser)
**Project Type**: Web application
**Performance Goals**: The Session Page SHALL load and display content within 2 seconds on a typical broadband connection.
**Constraints**: The Session Page SHALL be fully responsive and usable across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile). The Session Page SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards.
**Scale/Scope**: Single page for session details, accessible from Timetable.

```

**Structure Decision**: The project will extend the existing `src/` directory structure. A new route will be created under `src/app/timetable/[sessionId]` for the dedicated Session Page. New components for `SpeakerCard` and `SessionDetail` will be added to `src/components/common` and `src/features/timetable/components` respectively. Data files `sessions.json` and `speakers.json` will be managed under `src/data`. Type definitions will be updated in `src/types/index.ts`.
