# Feature Specification: Session Page

## 1. Overview

The Session Page provides attendees with a comprehensive view of a single talk, enabling them to evaluate its relevance and content before deciding to attend. It will display detailed information about the session, including its title, a long description, skill level, learning perspective, and a profile card for the presenter(s). This page is designed to be easily accessible from the Timetable and will maintain a consistent visual style with the rest of the application.

## 2. User Stories

- As an attendee, I want to view the detailed information of a specific talk so that I can decide if it aligns with my interests and learning goals.
- As an attendee, I want to see the skill level and learning perspective of a talk clearly highlighted so that I can quickly assess its suitability for me.
- As an attendee, I want to learn more about the speaker(s) of a talk, including their biography and social links, to understand their expertise and background.
- As an attendee, I want to access the session details seamlessly from the Timetable, without losing my context of the overall schedule.

- **Q1: Session Page Implementation Type:** Should the Session Page be implemented as a dedicated route (e.g., `/sessions/[sessionId]`) or as a modal overlay on the Timetable page?
- **Q2: Speaker Data Source:** Is speaker data embedded directly within the session data (e.g., `sessions.json`), or is it a separate data entity that needs to be fetched and joined (e.g., `speakers.json`)?
