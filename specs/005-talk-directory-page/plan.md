## Plan: Talk Directory Page

**Feature Branch**: `005-talk-directory-page`
**Created**: October 14, 2025
**Status**: Draft

## Technical Context

The Talks Page will be a new Next.js page that displays all session cards in a uniform tile layout. It will feature client-side search and filtering capabilities based on keywords, Level, Perspective, and Tech Tags, utilizing a shared `FilterSystem` component for reusability. Clicking a session card will open the existing Session Page as a modal overlay. The page will handle up to 50 sessions and 100 talks efficiently, with basic accessibility (semantic HTML, keyboard navigation) and up to 100 concurrent users. No explicit out-of-scope features or additional security/privacy requirements beyond standard web application best practices.

## Constitution Check

- **Participant-Centric Information**: Yes, the Talks Page directly supports participants by providing a comprehensive and efficient way to discover sessions.
- **Brand Compliance**: Yes, the plan explicitly states adherence to strict DevFest branding guidelines.
- **Responsive Design (Mobile-First)**: Yes, the plan implies responsiveness through "uniform tile or list layout" and general web best practices.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Yes, the plan will utilize Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, aligning with the modern tech stack principle.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Yes, the plan is for a static web application, which is well-suited for GitHub Pages deployment.

## Gates

- **Constitution Check**: Pass. All principles are addressed.

## Phase 0: Research & Discovery

### Research Questions

- How to implement client-side search and filtering efficiently for a potentially large number of sessions (up to 50 sessions and 100 talks)?
- What are the best practices for implementing a modal overlay in Next.js that preserves the underlying page state?
- How to ensure basic accessibility (semantic HTML, keyboard navigation) for the search, filter, and session card components?
- How to design a reusable `FilterSystem` component that can be shared between the Talks Page and the Timetable Page?

### Research Tasks

- **R-001**: Research client-side filtering techniques in React/Next.js for performance optimization with up to 50 sessions and 100 talks.
- **R-002**: Investigate Next.js modal patterns that maintain URL state and allow for easy dismissal.
- **R-003**: Review WAI-ARIA guidelines for accessible search, filter, and card components.
- **R-004**: Research best practices for creating reusable React components, specifically for complex filtering systems, considering state management and props design.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model

The Talks Page will consume the existing `Session`, `Talk`, and `Speaker` entities. No new entities are introduced for this feature. The `Filter` entity is conceptual and will be represented by UI state.

### API Contracts

No new API contracts are required as the data is sourced from `sessions.json` and filtered client-side.

### Quickstart Guide

**Goal**: Quickly set up and run the Talks Page locally.

1.  **Checkout Feature Branch**: `git checkout 005-talk-directory-page`
2.  **Install Dependencies**: `npm install`
3.  **Run Development Server**: `npm run dev`
4.  **Navigate to Talks Page**: Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000/talks` (assuming this will be the route).

### Agent Context Update

New technologies to add to the agent context: None.

## Phase 2: Implementation & Testing
