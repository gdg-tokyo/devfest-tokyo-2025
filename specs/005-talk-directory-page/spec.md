# Feature Specification: Talk Directory Page

**Feature Branch**: `005-talk-directory-page` **Status**: In Progress

## Overview

The Talk Directory Page is the central hub for attendees to discover and explore all available talks. It provides a comprehensive, filterable view of all sessions, allowing users to quickly find content that matches their interests and skill level.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1: Browse All Talks

As a user, I want to see all talks in a scannable layout to get an overview of the event.

- **Acceptance**: All talks are displayed in a uniform grid.

### User Story 2: Find Specific Talks

As a user, I want to search and filter talks to find ones that interest me.

- **Acceptance**:
  - I can search by keyword (title, abstract, speaker).
  - I can filter by Level, Perspective, and Tech Tags.
  - The talk list updates automatically as I apply filters.

### User Story 3: View Talk Details

As a user, I want to click on a talk to see more details.

- **Acceptance**:
  - Clicking a talk navigates to the talk detail page.

## Edge Cases
