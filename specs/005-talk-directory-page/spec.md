# Feature Specification: Talk Directory Page

**Feature Branch**: `005-talk-directory-page`
**Created**: October 14, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "talk directory page The Talks Page (or Talk Search Directory) functions as the comprehensive, unconstrained interface for session discovery, acting as the primary hub for the User Story 3 pre-exploration journey. Unlike the time-bound Timetable, this page presents all session cards in a uniform tile or list layout, ensuring all content is easily scannable. It features the site's most powerful, unified client-side search and filtering system, enabling users to rapidly narrow the vast list using a free keyword search, and structured filters based on Level, Perspective, and Tech Tags. Each session tile utilizes the strict DevFest branding to convey immediate context, and clicking a tile immediately triggers the display of the Session Page modal for detailed review."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 2 - Search and Filter Sessions (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to quickly find sessions of interest using a free keyword search and structured filters (Level, Perspective, Tech Tags) so that I can narrow down the vast list of talks efficiently.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality for session discovery and a primary value proposition of the page.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by applying various search terms and filter combinations and verifying that the displayed sessions match the criteria.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I am on the Talks Page, **When** I enter a keyword in the search bar, **Then** only session cards matching the keyword in their title, description, or speaker names are displayed.
2.  **Given** I am on the Talks Page, **When** I select a "Level" filter, **Then** only session cards matching that skill level are displayed.
3.  **Given** I am on the Talks Page, **When** I select a "Perspective" filter, **Then** only session cards matching that learning perspective are displayed.
4.  **Given** I am on the Talks Page, **When** I select a "Tech Tag" filter, **Then** only session cards associated with that tech tag are displayed.
5.  **Given** I am on the Talks Page, **When** I apply multiple filters (e.g., keyword + level), **Then** only session cards matching all criteria are displayed.
6.  **Given** I am on the Talks Page with filters applied, **When** I clear a filter, **Then** the session cards are updated to reflect the removal of that filter.

### User Story 3 - View Detailed Session Information (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to view the detailed information of a specific session by clicking on its card so that I can decide if it aligns with my interests and learning goals.

**Why this priority**: This allows users to delve deeper into sessions after initial discovery, providing essential context.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking on any talk card and verifying that the Session Page modal that include the clicked talk appears with the correct details for that session.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1.  **Given** I am on the Talks Page, **When** I click on a talk card, **Then** the Session Page modal that the clicked talk is included in appears, displaying the detailed information for that session.
2.  **Given** the Session Page modal is open, **When** I click outside the modal or on a close button, **Then** the modal closes, and I return to the Talks Page with my previous search/filter state preserved.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when no sessions match the search or filter criteria? (Display a "No results found" message).
- How does the system handle very long session descriptions or speaker bios? (Ensure text wraps appropriately and the layout remains stable).
- What if a session has no assigned level, perspective, or tech tags? (Filters should gracefully handle missing data, and the card should not display empty tags).
- What if a speaker has no photoUrl or social links? (The CSS avatar fallback and graceful handling of missing links should be in place).
