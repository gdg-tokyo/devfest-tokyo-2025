- [X] T006 [US2] Integrate the `FilterSystem` component into `src/app/talks/page.tsx`.
- [X] T007 [US2] Implement client-side filtering logic within `src/app/talks/page.tsx` to dynamically update displayed session cards based on search and filter criteria from the `FilterSystem` component (FR-004).
- [X] T008 [US2] Display a "No results found" message when no sessions match (FR-005).
