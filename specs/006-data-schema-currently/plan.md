# Implementation Plan: Data Schema Refactoring

- **Branch**: `006-data-schema-currently` | **Date**: 2025-10-18 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
- **Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/006-data-schema-currently/spec.md`

## Summary

The primary goal of this feature is to refactor the existing data structure. Currently, all data is stored in a single `sessions.json` file. This will be split into three separate files: `sessions.json`, `talks.json`, and `speakers.json`. This will simplify data management and improve the developer experience. The existing data parsing logic in `src/lib/data-parser.ts` will be updated to read from these new files and join the data.

## Technical Context

- **Language/Version**: TypeScript
- **Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, React
- **Storage**: JSON files
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Target Platform**: Web (GitHub Pages)
- **Project Type**: Web application
- **Performance Goals**: N/A
- **Constraints**: The existing functionality of the timetable page must be maintained.
- **Scale/Scope**: The refactoring will affect the data layer and the components that consume the data.

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

- **Participant-Centric Information**: Yes, this refactoring will make it easier to manage the data, which will indirectly improve the quality of the information provided to participants.
- **Brand Compliance**: Yes, this is a technical refactoring and does not affect the UI.
- **Responsive Design (Mobile-First)**: Yes, this is a technical refactoring and does not affect the UI.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Yes, the project uses Next.js and TypeScript.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Yes, this refactoring will not affect the deployment process.

    └── index.ts
```

**Structure Decision**: The project is a single web application. The main changes will be in the `src/data` directory, where the new JSON files will be created, and in `src/lib/data-parser.ts`, which will be updated to handle the new data structure.
