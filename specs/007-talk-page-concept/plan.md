# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

- **Branch**: `007-talk-page-concept` | **Date**: 2025-10-18 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
- **Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/007-talk-page-concept/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of a dedicated page for each talk. This page will display talk details, including title, abstract, schedule, and speaker information, and will be accessible via a unique URL. The page will also support rich previews when shared on social media (OGP). The implementation will use the existing Next.js and TypeScript-based frontend, sourcing data from local JSON files.

## Technical Context

- **Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x
- **Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Storage**: Local JSON files (`sessions.json`, `speakers.json`, `talks.json`)
- **Testing**: Jest, Playwright
- **Target Platform**: Web (GitHub Pages)
- **Project Type**: Web Application
- **Performance Goals**: 95% or higher score on Lighthouse performance audits.
- **Constraints**: Static site generation for deployment on GitHub Pages.
- **Scale/Scope**: A single page for each talk in the event.

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

- **Participant-Centric Information**: Yes, the plan provides detailed information about talks, which is crucial for participants.
- **Brand Compliance**: Yes, the new page will adhere to the existing design system and brand guidelines.
- **Responsive Design (Mobile-First)**: Yes, the implementation will follow the mobile-first approach of the existing application.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Yes, the plan uses the prescribed Next.js and Tailwind CSS stack.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Yes, the plan is designed for static site generation, which is suitable for GitHub Pages.

**Structure Decision**: The new talk page will be implemented within the existing Next.js application structure. A new route will be added in the `app/talks` directory, and a new feature component will be created in the `features/talk` directory.

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
