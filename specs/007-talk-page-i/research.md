# Research: Talk Page

No specific research was required for this feature. The technical approach is straightforward and relies on existing patterns within the codebase.

The implementation will involve:

- Creating a new dynamic route in Next.js for the talk pages.
- Fetching data from the existing local JSON files.
- Creating a new React component to display the talk details.
- Adding OGP meta tags to the page for social media sharing.

This approach is consistent with the existing architecture of the application.
