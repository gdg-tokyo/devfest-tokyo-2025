# Implementation Plan: App Header Design

- **Branch**: `008-app-nav-header` | **Date**: 2025-10-24 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
- **Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/008-app-nav-header/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The feature aims to enhance the application header by integrating the GDG Tokyo logo and name, providing clear navigation to the Timetable and Talk Directory pages, and featuring a prominent call-to-action button for event registration. The header will be responsive, adapting to mobile devices with a dropdown hamburger menu, and will ensure basic functionality even if JavaScript is disabled. Hover states for interactive elements will involve a color change.
