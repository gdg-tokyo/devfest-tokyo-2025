# Feature Specification: App Header Design

**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: DRAFT

## 1. Description

This feature improves the main application navigation bar to enhance brand recognition and provide clear navigation paths for users. The updated header will prominently display the GDG Tokyo logo and name, provide easy access to key pages (Timetable, Talk Directory), and include a strong call-to-action for event registration.

## 2. Rationale

The current navigation is not prominent enough. A well-designed header is crucial for user orientation and engagement. By making key links and the registration button consistently visible, we can improve the user journey and increase the likelihood of event registration. Displaying the community logo and name reinforces the event's identity.

## 3. User Scenarios / User Stories

- **As a website visitor**, I want to see the event's logo and name at the top of the page, so I can immediately recognize the organizer.
- **As a website visitor**, I want to find links to the "Timetable" and "Talk Directory" easily, so I can explore the event's content.
- **As a website visitor**, I want to see a clear "Register Now" button, so I can quickly go to the registration page.
- **As a website visitor**, when I click the registration button, I expect to be taken to the official connpass event page to complete my booking.

## 4. Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| FR-1 | The application header must be displayed consistently on all pages. |
| FR-2 | The header must display the GDG Tokyo logo on the far left. |
| FR-3 | The header must display the text "Google Developer Group Tokyo" next to the logo. |
| FR-4 | The header must include a navigation link that directs the user to the Timetable page (`/timetable`). |
| FR-5 | The header must include a navigation link that directs the user to the Talk Directory page (`/talks`). |
| FR-6 | The header must display a call-to-action button with the text "参加登録" on the far right. |
| FR-7 | Clicking the "参加登録" button must open the connpass event page (`https://gdg-tokyo.connpass.com/event/369416/`) in a new browser tab. |
| FR-8 | On smaller screen sizes (e.g., mobile devices), the header navigation links must collapse into a hamburger menu. |
| FR-9 | The hamburger menu, when clicked, should reveal the navigation links ("Timetable", "Talk Directory") as a dropdown menu directly below the header. |
| FR-10 | On desktop, hovering over navigation links or the call-to-action button must change the button color. |
| FR-11 | If JavaScript is disabled, the navigation links and the call-to-action button must function as basic HTML links. |
| FR-12 | The "参加登録" button must have a background color of `google-red-500`. |

## 5. Success Criteria

| ID | Criteria | Metric |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SC-1 | All navigation links in the header correctly route to the specified pages. | 100% of links are correct and functional. |
| SC-2 | The call-to-action button is easily identifiable and correctly links to the connpass page. | A user survey indicates that 95% of users can find the registration button within 5 seconds. |
| SC-3 | The header design is visually aligned with the DevFest brand guide. | 100% compliance with specified colors, fonts, and logo usage. |
| SC-4 | The header must load and be fully interactive within 500 milliseconds. | 500ms load time. |

## 6. Assumptions

- The GDG Tokyo logo asset is available in the project's `public/images` directory.
- The target URLs for the Timetable (`/timetable`) and Talk Directory (`/talks`) pages are correct.
- The connpass event URL is fixed and will not change.

## 7. Out of Scope

- The design and content of the pages linked from the header (Timetable, Talk Directory).
- User authentication or user-specific header states.
- Any changes to the footer of the application.
