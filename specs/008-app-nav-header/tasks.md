# Implementation Tasks: App Header Design

- **Branch**: `008-app-nav-header` | **Date**: 2025-10-24 | **Spec**: /Users/yoshimura708/code708/gdg/devfest-tokyo-2025-web/specs/008-app-nav-header/spec.md

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation tasks for the App Header Design feature, organized by user story and ordered by dependencies. The goal is to enhance brand recognition and provide clear navigation while ensuring responsiveness, accessibility, and performance.

## Dependencies

- User Story 1 (Brand Recognition) -> Foundational Tasks
- User Story 2 (Navigation Links) -> User Story 1
- User Story 3 (Call-to-Action Button) -> User Story 1
- Cross-Cutting Concerns -> User Story 1, User Story 2, User Story 3

## Implementation Strategy

We will adopt an incremental delivery approach, focusing on completing each user story sequentially. The MVP for this feature would be the successful implementation of User Story 1 (Brand Recognition).

## Phase 1: Setup Tasks

**Goal**: Prepare the development environment and review existing components.

- [x] T001: Review existing `src/components/Navbar.tsx` for potential modification or replacement. (File: `src/components/Navbar.tsx`)
- [x] T002: Verify `public/images/gdg-logo-24-color.png` is available in the project assets. (File: `public/images/gdg-logo-24-color.png`)

## Phase 2: Foundational Tasks

**Goal**: Establish the basic structure for the new header component.

- [x] T003: Create a new header component in `src/components/Header.tsx`, or decide to modify and rename `Navbar.tsx`. (File: `src/components/Header.tsx` or `src/components/Navbar.tsx`)
- [x] T004: Implement basic styling for the header using Tailwind CSS, ensuring it acts as a container for future elements. (File: `src/components/Header.tsx` or `src/components/Navbar.tsx`, `src/styles/globals.css`)

## Phase 3: User Story 1: Brand Recognition

**Goal**: Display the GDG Tokyo logo and community name in the header.

**Independent Test Criteria**: The header visibly displays the GDG Tokyo logo and the text "Google Developer Group Tokyo".

- [x] T005 [US1]: Integrate the `gdg-logo-24-color.png` image into the header component. (File: `src/components/Header.tsx`)
- [x] T006 [US1]: Add the text "Google Developer Group Tokyo" next to the logo within the header component. (File: `src/components/Header.tsx`)
- [x] T007 [US1]: Apply appropriate styling (e.g., font family, size, color) to the logo and text to align with the DevFest brand guide. (File: `src/components/Header.tsx`, `src/styles/globals.css`)

## Phase 4: User Story 2: Navigation Links

**Goal**: Provide functional and responsive navigation to the Timetable and Talk Directory pages.

**Independent Test Criteria**: The header contains clickable links to the Timetable and Talk Directory. On mobile, these links are accessible via a functional dropdown hamburger menu. Links remain accessible with JavaScript disabled.

- [x] T008 [US2]: Add a navigation link to the Timetable page (`/timetable`) in the header. (File: `src/components/Header.tsx`)
- [x] T009 [US2]: Add a navigation link to the Talk Directory page (`/talks`) in the header. (File: `src/components/Header.tsx`)
- [x] T010 [US2]: Implement responsive design to collapse desktop navigation links into a hamburger menu on smaller screens. (File: `src/components/Header.tsx`, `src/styles/globals.css`)
- [x] T011 [US2]: Implement the hamburger menu's click functionality to reveal the navigation links as a dropdown menu directly below the header. (File: `src/components/Header.tsx`)
- [x] T012 [US2]: Ensure the Timetable and Talk Directory navigation links function correctly as basic HTML links when JavaScript is disabled (e.g., using `<a>` tags with `href`). (File: `src/components/Header.tsx`)

## Phase 5: User Story 3: Call-to-Action Button

**Goal**: Integrate a prominent call-to-action button for event registration.

**Independent Test Criteria**: A clickable "参加登録" button is present, opening the correct connpass URL in a new tab. The button functions with JavaScript disabled.

- [x] T013 [US3]: Add a button with the text "参加登録" to the far right of the header component. (File: `src/components/Header.tsx`)
- [x] T014 [US3]: Configure the "参加登録" button to open the connpass event page (`https://gdg-tokyo.connpass.com/event/369416/`) in a new browser tab upon click. (File: `src/components/Header.tsx`)
- [x] T015 [US3]: Ensure the "参加登録" button functions as a basic HTML link to the connpass page when JavaScript is disabled. (File: `src/components/Header.tsx`)
- [x] T019 [US3]: Set the background color of the "参加登録" button to `google-red-500`. (File: `src/components/Header.tsx`)
- [x] T020 [P]: Add unit tests to verify the registration button has the correct `google-red-500` background color in both desktop and mobile views. (File: `tests/unit/components/Header.test.tsx`)

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Goal**: Fine-tune UI interactions and ensure performance targets are met.

**Independent Test Criteria**: Hover effects are applied to interactive elements. The header loads within the specified performance budget.

- [x] T016 [P]: Implement hover state styling (color change) for desktop navigation links and the "参加登録" button. (File: `src/components/Header.tsx`, `src/styles/globals.css`)
- [x] T017 [P]: Profile and optimize the header component to ensure it loads and is fully interactive within 500 milliseconds. (File: `src/components/Header.tsx`, `next.config.mjs`)
- [x] T018: Integrate the final header component into the main application layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`) to ensure consistent display across all pages. (File: `src/app/layout.tsx`)

## Parallel Execution Examples

**Within Phase 6:**

- T016 (Hover States) and T017 (Performance Optimization) can be worked on in parallel once the basic header structure and elements are in place.
