# Implementation Plan: Landing Page Hero Panel

- **Branch**: `009-landing-page-hero-section` | **Date**: 2025-10-25 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
- **Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/009-landing-page-hero-section/spec.md`

## 1. Feature Name

Landing Page Hero Panel

## 2. Technical Context

### 2.1 Description

The hero panel is a critical component of the landing page, designed to immediately engage users by presenting essential event information and key actions. It will feature the event logo, the theme, a real-time countdown to the event, and three distinct call-to-action buttons for registration, timetable, and talk directory.

### 2.2 Existing Technologies

- **Framework**: Next.js (React)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Language**: TypeScript

### 2.3 New Technologies/Libraries (Potential)

- **Countdown Timer**: A lightweight, efficient JavaScript library or a custom React hook for managing the countdown logic. (e.g., `react-countdown` or similar).

### 2.4 Architecture

- **UI Components**: The hero panel will be implemented as a reusable React component. Sub-components will include the logo display, theme text, countdown display, and individual action buttons.
- **Rendering**: The static elements (logo, theme, buttons) will be part of the initial static site generation. The countdown timer will be client-side rendered to ensure real-time updates without re-fetching data.
- **Asset Management**: The event logo will be a locally hosted static image, optimized for web performance.
- **Navigation**: Client-side routing for internal pages (Timetable, Talk Directory) using Next.js Link components. External navigation for the registration button to connpass.

### 2.5 Dependencies

- **Image Assets**: The `devfest25-tokyo-logo-with-gdg-bracket.png` logo image located at `@public/images/`.
- **Date/Time Utilities**: Standard JavaScript `Date` object or an external library for accurate countdown calculations.
- **Routing**: Next.js internal routing for `/timetable` and `/talks` paths being functional.

### 2.6 Constraints

- **Performance**: The component must load swiftly to contribute to a fast Time To Interactive (TTI) for the landing page.
- **Responsiveness**: The layout must adapt seamlessly across all standard device breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Accessibility**: All interactive elements (buttons) must meet WCAG guidelines for accessibility, including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
- **Branding**: Strict adherence to DevFest Tokyo 2025 brand guidelines for colors, fonts, and logo usage, especially for the specified blue/green button colors for Timetable and Talks.

### 2.7 Unknowns

- The specific choice between implementing a custom countdown hook versus using an existing library will need to be evaluated based on complexity, performance impact, and bundle size.
- Exact font sizes and spacing for responsive layouts across all breakpoints will need to be finalized during implementation within Tailwind CSS.

## 3. Constitution Check

### Against DevFest Tokyo 2025 Web Constitution (Version 1.0.3)

- **I. Participant-Centric Information**: **PASS**. The hero panel directly provides essential event information (theme, countdown) and directs users to key actions (registration, timetable, talks), enhancing their ability to engage with the event. This aligns with anticipating and fulfilling participant needs.
- **II. Brand Compliance**: **PASS**. The plan prioritizes strict adherence to the official DevFest brand guidelines, including the use of provided logos, specified blue/green colors for buttons, and theme text. This is essential for maintaining brand consistency and recognition.
- **III. Responsive Design (Mobile-First)**: **PASS**. NFR2 explicitly states the requirement for full responsiveness and optimization across devices. This component will be built with mobile-first principles in mind.
- **IV. Modern Tech Stack**: **PASS**. The plan leverages Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, aligning with the project's chosen modern tech stack. Emphasis on clean, maintainable code will be adhered to.
- **V. GitHub Pages Deployment**: **PASS**. The design to use static assets and client-side rendering for the countdown timer is compatible with GitHub Pages deployment, supporting the static site generation approach.

## 4. Gates for Proceeding

- All Constitution principles are met.
- No critical ambiguities or blockers are identified in the technical context that prevent further planning.

## 5. Phase 0: Outline & Research

### 5.1 Research Topics

- **Countdown Timer Implementation**: Investigate various approaches for implementing a real-time countdown timer in React/Next.js, with a focus on creating a visually impressive and customizable component. This includes evaluating existing npm packages (e.g., `react-countdown`) for their styling capabilities and flexibility, as well as exploring custom implementations (using `setInterval` or `requestAnimationFrame`) that allow for unique visual designs and animations, while considering performance, accuracy, and bundle size. The goal is to find a solution that fits the landing page aesthetic and provides a "wow" factor.
- **Next.js Image Optimization**: Research best practices for integrating and optimizing the logo image within a Next.js application, considering `next/image` component usage for performance benefits (lazy loading, responsive images, format optimization).
- **Tailwind CSS Responsive Design for Buttons**: Explore Tailwind CSS utilities and patterns for creating responsive button groups that adapt gracefully across different screen sizes while maintaining brand-compliant styling (red for registration, blue/green for timetable/talks). This includes ensuring proper spacing, alignment, and hover states.

## 6. Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### 6.1 data-model.md Content (Placeholder)

_(This section will define any new data structures required to support the hero panel, which is expected to be minimal as it is primarily a UI component. Potentially a simple interface for countdown properties.)_

### 6.2 contracts/ (Placeholder)

_(No new API contracts are anticipated for this UI-only feature.)_

### 6.3 quickstart.md Content (Placeholder)

_(This section will contain instructions to quickly set up and run the feature in isolation, if applicable.)_

### 6.4 Agent Context Update

_(This section will identify any new technologies or libraries introduced during the design phase that should be added to the agent's memory for future reference.)_

## 7. Phase 2: Implementation & Testing

_(This phase will encompass the actual coding, unit testing, integration testing, and potentially E2E testing of the hero panel component, following the established design and contracts.)_
