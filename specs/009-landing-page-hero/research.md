## Research Findings: Countdown Timer Implementation

### Decision: Use `react-flip-clock-countdown` for an impressive visual effect.

### Rationale:

The user requested a "more impressive" countdown timer that fits the landing page. `react-flip-clock-countdown` offers a visually engaging 3D flip-clock animation that can provide a "wow" factor. It also provides extensive customization options for styling, labels, and animation duration, which aligns well with the project's brand compliance requirements and the need for a unique aesthetic. This library strikes a good balance between visual impact and ease of integration compared to building a complex animated component from scratch.

### Alternatives Considered:

- **`react-countdown`**: A popular and versatile library, but its default visual presentation is more functional than "impressive." While customizable, achieving a unique visual style might require more effort than with `react-flip-clock-countdown`.
- **`react-timer-hook` / `use-timer`**: These are hook-based solutions that provide the core countdown logic, leaving the entire visual implementation to the developer. While offering maximum control, this would require significant development effort to create an "impressive" visual component from scratch, potentially increasing development time and complexity.
- **Custom Implementation (using `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`)**: Provides ultimate control over both logic and UI. However, it demands the most development time and careful handling of edge cases (e.g., time synchronization, performance optimization) to ensure accuracy and prevent bugs. The visual complexity requested would make this a more time-consuming option.
- **`nextjs-countdown-timer` (GitHub project)**: While specific to Next.js, it didn't offer the immediate visual impressiveness of `react-flip-clock-countdown` based on initial review, and its customization capabilities for a unique visual style were not as clearly highlighted.

### Research Findings: Next.js Image Optimization

- **Decision**: Utilize the `next/image` component for all image assets.
- **Rationale**: `next/image` provides automatic image optimization, including lazy loading, responsive sizing, and modern format conversion (e.g., WebP), which are crucial for performance and user experience. It also handles image sizing and breakpoints efficiently, reducing manual effort.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Standard `<img>` tags. Rejected due to lack of built-in optimization features, requiring manual implementation of lazy loading, responsive images, and format optimization.

### Research Findings: Tailwind CSS Responsive Design for Buttons

- **Decision**: Implement responsive button groups using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- **Rationale**: Tailwind CSS provides a highly flexible and efficient way to style components responsively. Its utility-first approach allows for precise control over layout, spacing, and appearance across different screen sizes. This will ensure brand-compliant styling (red for registration, blue/green for timetable/talks) and intuitive user interaction on all devices.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Custom CSS modules or styled-components. Rejected due to the project's existing adoption of Tailwind CSS, which offers a more streamlined and consistent styling workflow for responsive design.
