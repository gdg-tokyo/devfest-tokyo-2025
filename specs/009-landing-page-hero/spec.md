# Feature Specification: Landing Page Hero Panel

## 1. Overview

This document specifies the requirements for the Landing Page Hero Panel feature for the DevFest Tokyo 2025 website. The hero panel serves as the primary visual element on the landing page, designed to immediately convey event information and guide users towards key actions.

## 2. User Stories

- As a first-time visitor, I want to clearly see the event logo, theme, and a countdown to the event so I can quickly understand what DevFest Tokyo 2025 is about and when it will happen.
- As a potential attendee, I want to easily find and click a prominent "参加登録" (Register) button to navigate to the event registration page on connpass.
- As a user interested in the event content, I want to see clear call-to-action buttons for "タイムテーブル" (Timetable) and "Talk Directory" so I can explore the sessions and talks.

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **FR1: Display Event Branding**: The hero panel MUST prominently display the "DevFest Tokyo" event logo image.
- **FR2: Display Event Theme**: The hero panel MUST display the event theme split into a main title "Fine your new eyes" and a subtitle "~3つの新たな視点に出会える一日~".
