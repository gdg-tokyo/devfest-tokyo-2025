## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - View Event Overview (Priority: P1)

As a potential attendee visiting the website, I want to quickly see the key event details (date, time, location, and how to register) in a clear and visually appealing way on the landing page, so that I can decide if I am interested in attending.

#### Why this priority

This is the most critical information for a potential attendee. Displaying it prominently on the landing page is essential for driving registrations and ensuring users have the basic information they need.

#### Independent Test

The landing page can be loaded, and the event overview section can be visually inspected to confirm that the date, time, location, and registration link are present and correct. This can be tested without any other features being implemented.

#### Acceptance Scenarios

1.  **Given** a user navigates to the landing page, **When** the page loads, **Then** a section with event details is visible below the main welcome message.
2.  **Given** the section with event details is visible, **When** the user inspects it, **Then** it MUST display the event date and time, the event location, and a link or button for registration.
3.  **Given** the registration link/button is visible, **When** the user clicks on it, **Then** they are redirected to the official connpass event page (https://gdg-tokyo.connpass.com/event/369416/).

### Edge Cases

- What happens if the connpass link is broken or changes? The link should be easily configurable.
- How does the layout adapt to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)? The design should be responsive.
