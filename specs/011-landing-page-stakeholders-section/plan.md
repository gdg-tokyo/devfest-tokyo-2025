# Implementation Plan: Stakeholders Section

- **Branch**: `011-landing-page-stakeholders-section` | **Date**: 2025-10-26 | **Spec**: [./spec.md](./spec.md)
- **Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/011-landing-page-stakeholders-section/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature will implement a responsive "Stakeholders" section on the landing page, displaying partner logos grouped by tier (Organizer, Co-Organizer, Sponsor, Supporter). The data will be sourced from a local JSON file, with logos linking to partner websites. Key aspects include consistent logo height, automatic wrapping, hover highlighting, lazy-loading for performance, accessibility, and keyboard navigation. A mechanism for generating dummy data for development environments will also be included.

## Technical Context

- **Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x
- **Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Storage**: Local JSON file (`src/data/{ENV}/partners.json` or similar)
- **Testing**: Jest (unit/integration), Playwright (E2E)
- **Target Platform**: Web (Next.js application)
- **Project Type**: Web application (frontend)
- **Performance Goals**: Lazy-loading for images, average component load time under 500ms on slow 3G.
- **Constraints**: Responsive design, Lighthouse accessibility score 95+, keyboard navigation.
- **Scale/Scope**: Displaying a list of partners (expected ~50-100 partners initially), manageable via JSON file.
- **Unknowns**:
  - **JSON Data Structure**: Specific structure of the local JSON file for partner data (beyond `name`, `url`, `logo`, `tier`). NEEDS CLARIFICATION.
  - **Logo Sizing**: Specific implementation of "consistent height" for logos across different tiers. NEEDS CLARIFICATION.
  - **Hover Effect**: Specific implementation of "hover highlighting" for logos. NEEDS CLARIFICATION.

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

- **Participant-Centric Information**: ✅ The plan prioritizes providing participants with information about event partners.
- **Brand Compliance**: ✅ The plan adheres to the official DevFest brand guidelines by using logos and adhering to design principles.
- **Responsive Design (Mobile-First)**: ✅ The plan explicitly includes considerations for a mobile-first responsive design.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: ✅ The plan utilizes Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: ✅ The plan is optimized for deployment on GitHub Pages as it involves static content.

```

**Structure Decision**: The existing Next.js `src/features/` directory structure will be extended to include `landing-page/stakeholders`. A dedicated `data/stakeholders.json` will be created under `src/data/` for the stakeholder information.
