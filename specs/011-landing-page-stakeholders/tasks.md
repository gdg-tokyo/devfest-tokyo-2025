# Development Tasks: Stakeholders Section

- **Branch**: `011-landing-page-stakeholders` | **Date**: 2025-10-26 | **Spec**: /specs/011-landing-page-stakeholders/spec.md
- **Plan**: /specs/011-landing-page-stakeholders/plan.md

## Phase 1: Setup & Foundational Tasks

**Goal**: Establish the basic project structure and data handling for the feature.

- **T001 [Setup]**: Create the feature directory structure: `src/features/landing-page/stakeholders/`, `src/features/landing-page/stakeholders/components/`, `src/features/landing-page/stakeholders/hooks/`.
  - **File**: `src/features/landing-page/stakeholders/index.ts` (and subdirectories)
- **T002 [Foundational]**: Define TypeScript interfaces for `Stakeholder` and `StakeholderData` (array of Stakeholder) in `src/types/index.ts`.
  - **File**: `src/types/index.ts`
- **T003 [Foundational]**: Create `src/data/stakeholders.json` with initial production data (Organizer: GDG Tokyo, Co-Organizer: IPUT, Sponsor: Google, Supporter: empty array), ensuring logo paths are under `public/images/organizers-and-partners/`.
  - **File**: `src/data/stakeholders.json`
- **T004 [Foundational]**: Implement a utility function to load stakeholder data from `src/data/stakeholders.json` or `src/data/stakeholders.dev.json` based on environment, and filter/sort by tier. Place in `src/lib/data-utils.ts`.
  - **File**: `src/lib/data-utils.ts`
- **T005 [Foundational]**: Write unit tests for the data loading and filtering utility (`src/lib/data-utils.ts`).
  - **File**: `tests/unit/lib/data-utils.test.ts`

## Phase 2: User Story 1 - View Stakeholders (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Display the stakeholder logos on the landing page, grouped by tier, with links and hover effects. **Independent Test**: Verify that the "Stakeholders" section renders correctly on the landing page with the initial data, showing logos, links, and hover effects.

- **T006 [US1]**: Create the main `Stakeholders` React component in `src/features/landing-page/components/Stakeholders.tsx`. This component will fetch data using the utility from T004.
  - **File**: `src/features/landing-page/components/Stakeholders.tsx`
- **T007 [US1]**: Implement the UI for displaying stakeholder logos in a grid, grouped by tier, within `Stakeholders`. Apply consistent height and hover effects as per research.md.
  - **File**: `src/features/landing-page/components/Stakeholders.tsx`
- **T008 [US1]**: Ensure each logo is a clickable link opening in a new tab.
  - **File**: `src/features/landing-page/components/Stakeholders.tsx`
- **T009 [US1]**: Integrate the `Stakeholders` component into the main landing page (`src/app/page.tsx`).
  - **File**: `src/app/page.tsx`
- **T010 [US1]**: Write unit tests for `Stakeholders` component, verifying rendering of partners, links, and conditional display of tiers.
  - **File**: `tests/unit/features/landing-page/stakeholders/Stakeholders.test.tsx`
- **T011 [US1]**: Write E2E tests for US1, verifying the presence of the section, correct display of initial stakeholders, and functionality of links and hover effects.
  - **File**: `tests/e2e/landing-page-stakeholders.spec.ts`

## Phase 3: User Story 2 - Responsive and Accessible Viewing (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Ensure the "Organizers & Partners" section is fully responsive and accessible across devices and assistive technologies. **Independent Test**: Verify the layout adapts correctly on different screen sizes and that the component is navigable and readable by screen readers.

- **T012 [US2]**: Implement responsive design for the stakeholder logo grid using Tailwind CSS, ensuring clean wrapping and visual balance on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
  - **File**: `src/features/landing-page/components/Stakeholders.tsx`
- **T013 [US2]**: Ensure all stakeholder logo images have appropriate `alt` text for accessibility.
  - **File**: `src/features/landing-page/components/Stakeholders.tsx`
- **T014 [US2]**: Implement keyboard navigation for stakeholder links, ensuring focusability and activation via keyboard.
  - **File**: `src/features/landing-page/components/Stakeholders.tsx`
- **T015 [US2]**: Update unit tests (T010) to include accessibility checks (e.g., `alt` text presence).
  - **File**: `tests/unit/features/landing-page/stakeholders/Stakeholders.test.tsx`
- **T016 [US2]**: Update E2E tests (T011) to include responsive layout checks and keyboard navigation tests.
  - **File**: `tests/e2e/landing-page-stakeholders.spec.ts`

--- Checkpoint: User Story 2 Complete ---

## Phase 4: User Story 3 - Content Management (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Enable easy content updates via JSON file modification and ensure dummy data is used in development. **Independent Test**: Verify that modifying `partners.json` updates the displayed content and that `partners.dev.json` is used in development.

- **T017 [US3]**: Implement logic in the data utility (T004) to prioritize `stakeholders.dev.json` over `stakeholders.json` when in a development environment.
  - **File**: `src/lib/data-utils.ts`
- **T018 [US3]**: Verify that updating `src/data/stakeholders.json` (or `stakeholders.dev.json` in dev) correctly refreshes the displayed content after a rebuild.
  - **File**: `tests/e2e/landing-page-stakeholders.spec.ts` (update existing test)
- **T019 [US3]**: Add an E2E test to specifically verify that `stakeholders.dev.json` is used in the development environment.
  - **File**: `tests/e2e/landing-page-stakeholders.spec.ts`

--- Checkpoint: User Story 3 Complete ---

## Phase 5: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Goal**: Address remaining non-functional requirements and ensure overall quality.

- **T020 [Polish]**: Implement lazy-loading for all stakeholder logo images.
  - **File**: `src/features/landing-page/components/Stakeholders.tsx`
- **T021 [Polish]**: Ensure error logging (SC-005) for failed image loads or data parsing is implemented.
  - **File**: `src/features/organizer-partner-section/components/OrganizerPartnerSection.tsx`, `src/lib/data-utils.ts`
- **T022 [Polish]**: Optimize component for performance to meet SC-006 (average load time under 500ms).
  - **File**: `src/features/organizer-partner-section/components/OrganizerPartnerSection.tsx`
- **T023 [Polish]**: Conduct a final Lighthouse audit to ensure SC-002 (accessibility score 95+) is met.
  - **Tool**: Lighthouse

## Dependencies

The user stories are designed for incremental delivery.

- User Story 1 (P1) is foundational.
- User Story 2 (P2) builds on US1.
- User Story 3 (P3) can be developed in parallel with US2 or after US1.

**Story Completion Order**: US1 → US2 → US3 (or US1 → (US2, US3))

## Parallel Execution Examples

**Within User Story 1:**

- T006 (Create main component) and T007 (Implement UI) can be done sequentially.
- T008 (Ensure links) can be done after T007.
- T009 (Integrate into landing page) can be done after T006/T007.
- T010 (Unit tests) and T011 (E2E tests) can be done in parallel with T006-T009, following TDD principles.

**Across User Stories:**

- Once US1 is complete, US2 and US3 can be worked on in parallel.

## Implementation Strategy

The feature will be implemented incrementally, prioritizing core functionality (US1) first, followed by quality attributes (US2), and then content management (US3). This approach allows for early delivery of a functional MVP and continuous integration of feedback.
