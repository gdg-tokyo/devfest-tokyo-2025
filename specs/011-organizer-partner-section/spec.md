# Feature Specification: Organizer & Partners Section

- **Feature Branch**: `011-organizer-partner-section`
- **Created**: 2025-10-26
- **Status**: Draft
- **Input**: User description: "organizer partner section Create a responsive “Organizers & Partners” section on the landing page inspired by Kotlin Fest’s sponsor layout. It should display four groups—Organizer, Co-Organizer, Sponsor, and Supporter—in that order, each with logos linking to partner sites. Data must come from a simple JSON file containing name, url, and logo fields (plus optional tier). Logos appear in clean, centered grids with consistent height, automatic wrapping by tier, hover highlighting, dark/light-mode variants, and lazy-loading for performance. Empty groups are hidden automatically. Updating the data file alone should refresh the content, ensuring accessibility, keyboard navigation, and visual balance across devices. - 主催: GDG Tokyo - 共催: 東京国際工科専門職大学 (IPUT) - 協賛: Google"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-26

- Q: What level of observability is required for the "Organizers & Partners" section? → A: Both basic error logging and performance metrics.

### User Story 1 - View Organizers and Partners (Priority: P1)

As a site visitor, I want to see the logos of the event organizers, co-organizers, sponsors, and supporters on the landing page, so that I can recognize who is backing the event and explore their websites.

#### Why this priority

This is a fundamental feature for acknowledging event partners and providing credibility to the event. It's a common and expected section on any conference website.

#### Independent Test

The "Organizers & Partners" section can be added to the landing page and tested to ensure it renders correctly with the initial data, even if other page sections are not yet complete. The core value is delivered as long as the logos are visible and clickable.

#### Acceptance Scenarios

1.  **Given** a visitor is on the landing page, **When** they scroll to the "Organizers & Partners" section, **Then** they SHOULD see the "Organizer", "Co-Organizer", and "Sponsor" groups displayed in that order.
2.  **Given** the "Supporter" group has no partners in the data file, **When** the page loads, **Then** the "Supporter" group title and section SHOULD NOT be visible.
3.  **Given** a visitor sees the "Google" logo in the "Sponsor" group, **When** they click on the logo, **Then** they SHOULD be navigated to the URL specified for Google in a new browser tab.
4.  **Given** a visitor hovers over a partner logo, **When** the mouse is over the logo, **Then** the logo SHOULD have a distinct visual highlighting effect (e.g., slight zoom or shadow).

### User Story 2 - Responsive and Accessible Viewing (Priority: P2)

As a user on any device (desktop, tablet, or mobile), I want to view the partner logos in a visually balanced and accessible format, so that I can have a good experience regardless of my device or if I use assistive technologies.

#### Why this priority

Ensuring a good user experience across all devices and for all users is crucial for a public-facing website.

#### Independent Test

The layout and accessibility of the component can be tested independently using browser developer tools and screen readers.

#### **Acceptance Scenarios**

1.  **Given** a user is viewing the page on a mobile device, **When** they look at the partner logos, **Then** the logos SHOULD wrap cleanly and be displayed in a single-column or two-column grid that fits the screen width.
2.  **Given** a user is navigating the page using a keyboard, **When** they tab through the elements, **Then** each partner logo SHOULD be focusable and the link should be activatable via the "Enter" key.
3.  **Given** a user with a screen reader is on the page, **When** they navigate to a partner logo, **Then** the screen reader SHOULD announce the partner's name (e.g., "Google, link").

### User Story 3 - Content Management (Priority: P3)

As a site administrator, I want to update the list of partners by simply modifying a JSON file, so that I can easily manage the content without needing to change any code.

#### Why this priority

This simplifies content management and allows non-developers to update the site, which is important for keeping the partner list current.

#### Independent Test

This can be tested by modifying the data file and rebuilding the site (in a static site generation context) to see if the changes are reflected.

#### Acceptance Scenarios

1.  **Given** a new sponsor is added to the JSON data file, **When** the site is rebuilt and deployed, **Then** the new sponsor's logo SHOULD appear in the "Sponsor" section on the landing page.
2.  **Given** a partner is removed from the JSON data file, **When** the site is rebuilt and deployed, **Then** the partner's logo SHOULD no longer be visible on the landing page.
3.  **Given** the application is running in a development environment, **When** the dummy data generation process is executed, **Then** a set of predefined dummy organizer and partner data SHOULD be available for display.

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when** the JSON data file is malformed or cannot be read? The build process should fail with a clear error message. The live site should not break.
- **What happens when** a partner's logo URL is broken or the image fails to load? A placeholder or alt text should be displayed gracefully.
- **What happens when** a partner's name is very long? The name should wrap gracefully or be truncated with an ellipsis if displayed visually (though alt text should remain full).
- **What happens when** there are no partners in any category? The entire "Organizers & Partners" section should be hidden.
- **What happens when** dummy data is generated for a production environment? The dummy data generation process SHOULD NOT overwrite or interfere with production data.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST display partner logos in four distinct, ordered groups: "Organizer", "Co-Organizer", "Sponsor", and "Supporter".
- **FR-002**: The system MUST source all partner data from a single, local JSON file.
- **FR-003**: Each partner logo MUST be a clickable link that opens the partner's URL in a new tab.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST hide any group that does not have any partners listed in the data file.
- **FR-005**: The layout MUST be responsive, adapting the grid of logos to fit different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **FR-006**: All partner logos MUST be lazy-loaded to improve page performance.
- **FR-007**: A visual highlighting effect MUST be applied when a user hovers over a partner logo.
- **FR-008**: The component MUST be navigable using a keyboard.
- **FR-009**: All images MUST have appropriate alt text for accessibility.

### Key Entities

- **Partner**: Represents an organization supporting the event.
  - **Attributes**:
    - `name` (string): The official name of the partner.
    - `url` (string): The URL to the partner's website.
    - `logo` (string): The file path or URL for the partner's logo image.
    - `tier` (string): The category of partnership ("Organizer", "Co-Organizer", "Sponsor", "Supporter").

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of partners listed in the data file are correctly displayed in their respective groups on the landing page.
- **SC-002**: The "Organizers & Partners" section achieves a Lighthouse accessibility score of 95 or higher.
- **SC-003**: On first load, partner logos that are below the fold should not be loaded, as measured by checking the network requests in browser developer tools.
- **SC-004**: A content update (adding/removing a partner in the JSON) can be performed and verified on the live site in under 5 minutes by a non-developer (assuming a static site build process).
- **SC-005**: The component logs errors for 100% of failed image loads or data parsing issues.
- **SC-006**: The component's average load time is under 500ms on a slow 3G connection. .
