# Implementation Plan: Responsive Layout Rule

- **Branch**: `013-responsive-layout-rule` | **Date**: October 26, 2025 | **Spec**: /Users/yoshimura708/code708/gdg/devfest-tokyo-2025-web/specs/013-responsive-layout-rule/spec.md
- **Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/013-responsive-layout-rule/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The primary requirement is to provide a consistent and optimized website experience across mobile, tablet, and PC devices by adapting the layout based on screen width. This will involve implementing a three-tiered responsive design with distinct breakpoints and column configurations for each device type, ensuring high customer satisfaction and accessibility.

## Technical Context

- **Language/Version**: TypeScript
- **Primary Dependencies**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Storage**: N/A (static site)
- **Testing**: Jest (unit/integration), Playwright (E2E)
- **Target Platform**: Web (GitHub Pages deployment)
- **Project Type**: Web
- **Performance Goals**: Layout transitions should be smooth and fast (under 0.5 seconds). Pages should load without horizontal scrollbars on all supported device widths.
- **Constraints**: Must adhere to DevFest brand guidelines. Mobile-first approach.
- **Scale/Scope**: Website for DevFest Tokyo 2025 attendees.

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

- **Participant-Centric Information**: [x] Yes, the responsive design ensures participants can access information easily on any device, enhancing their experience.
- **Brand Compliance**: [x] Yes, the responsive design will ensure brand elements are displayed correctly across devices.
- **Responsive Design (Mobile-First)**: [x] Yes, this feature directly addresses and enhances responsive design, explicitly adopting a mobile-first approach with three tiers.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: [x] Yes, the plan utilizes Next.js and Tailwind CSS, aligning with the constitution.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: [x] Yes, responsive design is crucial for a web application deployed on GitHub Pages, ensuring broad accessibility.

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
