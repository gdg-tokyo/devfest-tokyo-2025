# Quickstart: Responsive Layout Rule

This quickstart guide outlines the basic steps to implement and verify the three-tiered responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and PC.

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Configure Tailwind CSS Breakpoints**: Ensure that Tailwind CSS is configured with the default `md` (768px) and `lg` (1024px) breakpoints, or custom breakpoints that match these values.
2.  **Apply Responsive Utility Classes**: Utilize Tailwind CSS responsive utility classes (e.g., `md:`, `lg:`) within your Next.js components to define layout changes at the specified breakpoints.
    - For single-column mobile layout: Apply default styles without prefixes.
    - For two-column tablet layout: Use `md:grid-cols-2` or similar for grid-based layouts.
    - For three-column PC layout: Use `lg:grid-cols-3` or similar for grid-based layouts.
3.  **Ensure Content Centering**: Apply `mx-auto` and appropriate `max-w-*` classes to content containers to ensure horizontal centering and controlled width.
4.  **Backgrounds**: Allow section backgrounds to span full width by not applying width constraints to the background elements.

## Verification Steps

1.  **Run Development Server**: Start the Next.js development server (`npm run dev`).
2.  **Browser Testing**: Open the website in a web browser and perform the following:
    - **Mobile View**: Resize the browser window to a width less than 768px. Verify that content is displayed in a single column and is readable.
    - **Tablet View**: Resize the browser window to a width between 768px and 1023px. Verify that content transitions to a multi-column layout (e.g., 2 columns) and remains readable.
    - **PC View**: Resize the browser window to a width of 1024px or greater. Verify that content transitions to a multi-column layout (e.g., 3 columns) and remains readable.
    - **Resizing Test**: Slowly resize the browser window across the 768px and 1024px breakpoints to observe smooth transitions without content overlap or distortion.
3.  **Device Emulation**: Use browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools device mode) to emulate various mobile and tablet devices and confirm correct rendering.
4.  **Accessibility Check**: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible and functional across all responsive views.
