# Research: Responsive Layout Rule Implementation

## Decision: Implementation Approach

- **Decision**: Implement the three-tiered responsive layout using Tailwind CSS's built-in responsive utility classes.
- **Rationale**: Tailwind CSS is already part of the project's modern tech stack as per the Constitution. Its utility-first approach with responsive prefixes (e.g., `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) directly supports the mobile-first design principle and simplifies the implementation of breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and PC. This approach avoids custom media queries and promotes consistency.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - **Custom CSS Media Queries**: Rejected because Tailwind CSS provides a more streamlined and integrated solution within the existing tech stack, reducing boilerplate and improving development speed.
  - **JavaScript-based Responsive Solutions**: Rejected to avoid client-side performance overhead and potential FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content). CSS-based solutions are generally preferred for layout responsiveness.

## Breakpoint Configuration

- **Decision**: Utilize Tailwind CSS's default breakpoints or configure custom breakpoints to match the specified 768px (tablet) and 1024px (PC) thresholds.
- **Rationale**: Tailwind CSS provides `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl` breakpoints by default. The `md` breakpoint is typically 768px and `lg` is 1024px, which aligns perfectly with the requirements for tablet and PC. This allows for direct use of existing utilities without extensive custom configuration.
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - **Custom Breakpoints**: While possible in Tailwind CSS, using the default `md` and `lg` breakpoints simplifies configuration and leverages common responsive design patterns, reducing the need for custom setup unless specific design requirements dictate otherwise.
