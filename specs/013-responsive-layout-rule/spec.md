# Feature Specification: Responsive Layout Rule

- **Feature Branch**: `013-responsive-layout-rule`
- **Created**: October 26, 2025
- **Status**: Draft
- **Input**: User description: "Update website layout to support 3 levels: mobile + tablet + PC. table and PC are basically the same but use the different column number for better visibility. Update the current two level reponsive spec in @specs/013-responsive-layout-rule/spec.md"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Consistent Content Presentation Across Devices (Priority: P1)

Users can view the website content clearly and consistently, regardless of whether they are using a mobile device, a tablet, or a desktop computer. The layout adapts to the screen size to provide an optimal viewing experience.

#### Why this priority

This is fundamental for accessibility and usability. Without a responsive layout, the website would be difficult or impossible to use on various devices, leading to a poor user experience and potential loss of engagement.

#### Independent Test

This can be fully tested by navigating through all pages of the website on different device types (e.g., a smartphone, a tablet, and a desktop monitor) and observing that content is always readable, correctly formatted, and all interactive elements are accessible.

#### Acceptance Scenarios

1.  **Given** a user is browsing the website on a mobile device (screen width < 768px), **When** they navigate to any page, **Then** the content is displayed in a single-column layout, and all text, images, and components are clearly visible and interactable.
2.  **Given** a user is browsing the website on a tablet device (screen width ≥ 768px and < 1024px), **When** they navigate to any page, **Then** the content is displayed in a multi-column layout (e.g., 2 columns) where appropriate, and all text, images, and components are clearly visible and interactable.
3.  **Given** a user is browsing the website on a desktop computer (screen width ≥ 1024px), **When** they navigate to any page, **Then** the content is displayed in a multi-column layout (e.g., 3 columns) where appropriate, and all text, images, and components are clearly visible and interactable.
4.  **Given** a user resizes their browser window, **When** the screen width crosses the 768px or 1024px thresholds, **Then** the layout smoothly transitions between mobile, tablet, and PC views without content overlap or distortion.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the screen width is exactly 768px or 1024px? (It should behave as the larger layout, i.e., tablet for 768px, PC for 1024px).
- How does the system handle extremely narrow screens (e.g., less than 320px wide)? (Content should remain readable and scrollable horizontally if necessary, but ideally adapt without horizontal scroll).
- How does the system handle extremely wide screens (e.g., ultra-wide monitors)? (Content should remain centered and not stretch excessively, maintaining readability).

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The website MUST present content in a layout optimized for the user's screen width, supporting mobile, tablet, and PC views.
- **FR-002**: The website MUST use breakpoints at 768 pixels (for tablet) and 1024 pixels (for PC) to differentiate between layout tiers.
- **FR-003**: For screen widths less than 768 pixels, the website MUST display content in a single-column format.
- **FR-004**: For screen widths equal to or greater than 768 pixels and less than 1024 pixels, the website MUST display content in a multi-column format, with a column count optimized for tablet visibility (e.g., 2 columns).
- **FR-005**: For screen widths equal to or greater than 1024 pixels, the website MUST display content in a multi-column format, with a column count optimized for PC visibility (e.g., 3 columns).
- **FR-006**: All primary content sections MUST be horizontally centered on the page.
- **FR-007**: Section backgrounds MAY extend to the full width of the viewport, independent of the centered content.

### Key Entities

- **Website Content**: Refers to all textual, visual, and interactive elements displayed on the website, including text, images, and components.
- **Layout**: The arrangement of content on a page, which can be single-column, two-column (tablet), or three-column (PC).
- **Viewport**: The visible area of a web page in a browser window.

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 100% of website pages load without horizontal scrollbars on standard mobile device widths (e.g., 320px to 767px), tablet widths (e.g., 768px to 1023px), and PC widths (e.g., 1024px to 1920px).
- **SC-002**: When resizing the browser window across the 768px and 1024px breakpoints, the layout transition completes within 0.5 seconds without visual artifacts or content reflow issues.
- **SC-003**: User feedback (e.g., surveys, usability testing) indicates that 95% of users find the website easy to navigate and read on mobile, tablet, and PC devices.
- **SC-004**: All interactive elements (buttons, links, forms) are fully accessible and clickable on mobile, tablet, and PC layouts.
