# Tasks: Responsive Layout Rule

- **Feature Branch**: `013-responsive-layout-rule`
- **Date**: October 26, 2025
- **Spec**: /Users/yoshimura708/code708/gdg/devfest-tokyo-2025-web/specs/013-responsive-layout-rule/spec.md

## Phase 1: Setup Tasks

- [x] **T001**: Verify Tailwind CSS configuration for `md` (768px) and `lg` (1024px) breakpoints. Ensure `tailwind.config.ts` correctly defines or extends these breakpoints if custom values are needed. [US1]

## Phase 2: Foundational Tasks

_No specific foundational tasks that block all user stories, as the core implementation is directly tied to applying responsive classes within components._

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Consistent Content Presentation Across Devices (P1)

**Goal**: Users can view the website content clearly and consistently, regardless of whether they are using a mobile device, a tablet, or a desktop computer. The layout adapts to the screen size to provide an optimal viewing experience.

**Independent Test Criteria**:

- All pages load without horizontal scrollbars on mobile (320-767px), tablet (768-1023px), and PC (1024-1920px).

- Layout transitions across 768px and 1024px breakpoints are smooth (within 0.5s) without visual artifacts.

- User feedback indicates 95% satisfaction with readability and navigation on all devices.

- All interactive elements are accessible and functional across all responsive views.

- [x] **T002 (US1)**: Identify common layout components (e.g., `src/components/Header.tsx`, `src/components/Footer.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`, and any components within `src/features/`) that require responsive adjustments. [P]

- [x] **T003 (US1)**: Apply Tailwind CSS responsive utility classes to identified components to implement single-column layout for mobile (default). This involves ensuring that elements stack vertically and are appropriately sized for smaller screens.

- [x] **T004 (US1)**: Apply Tailwind CSS responsive utility classes to identified components to implement two-column layout for tablet (`md:grid-cols-2` or similar). This task focuses on optimizing content arrangement for medium-sized screens.

- [x] **T005 (US1)**: Apply Tailwind CSS responsive utility classes to identified components to implement three-column layout for PC (`lg:grid-cols-3` or similar). This task focuses on maximizing content display for larger screens.

- [x] **T006 (US1)**: Ensure all primary content sections are horizontally centered using `mx-auto` and appropriate `max-w-*` classes within their respective containers.

- [x] **T007 (US1)**: Verify that section backgrounds can extend to full width independently of content centering, ensuring visual continuity across the viewport.

- [x] **T008 (US1)**: Conduct browser testing as per `quickstart.md` to verify responsive behavior across mobile, tablet, and PC views. This includes manual resizing and checking for visual integrity.

- [x] **T009 (US1)**: Use browser developer tools for device emulation to confirm correct rendering on various mobile and tablet devices, paying attention to specific device dimensions and orientations.

- [x] **T010 (US1)**: Perform accessibility checks to ensure interactive elements are functional and usable across all responsive views, including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

## Phase 4: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [x] **T011**: Review the entire website for consistent application of responsive design principles and address any remaining visual inconsistencies or minor layout issues.
- [x] **T012**: Document any specific responsive design patterns, custom utility classes, or guidelines established during implementation for future development and maintenance in the project's documentation.

## Dependencies

- US1: No direct dependencies on other user stories.

## Parallel Execution Examples

Within US1, tasks T003, T004, T005, T006, and T007 can be parallelized across different components or sections of the website, as they involve applying styling independently.

## Implementation Strategy

This feature will be implemented using an incremental delivery approach, focusing on completing User Story 1 as the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The responsive design will be applied iteratively to different components and sections of the website, with continuous testing and verification at each step.
