# Data Model: Google Analytics Integration

This feature does not introduce any new data models to the application's backend or database.

All data related to this feature is collected and managed by Google Analytics. The data entities are defined within the Google Analytics 4 platform and include:

- **Events**: Such as `page_view`.
- **User Properties**: Such as demographic information (age, gender, location).
- **Traffic Sources**: Information about how users arrived at the website.

There are no changes to the application's own data persistence layer.
